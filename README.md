## 1. Project Overview

The Project aims to detect whether a Credit card transaction is Legit or Fraudulent using Machine Learning Techniques in Python.

## 2. Dataset 

Download the Dataset here : [Credit card](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/code)
This Dataset contains:

- A large number of transactions with various features.

- As the credit card informations are highly sensitive the features are named as V1,V2...

- A highly unbalanced distribution of Legit vs. fraudulent transactions.
  

## 3. Data Preprocessing

- Loading the dataset using Pandas.

- Checking for missing values and handling them accordingly.

- As the dataset was highly unbalanced. To balance the ratio, the dataset was split into legit_transactions and fraud_transactions.

- Perform scaling and selection.

- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.


## 4. Model Training

- As the data can be classified into legit and fraud we will be using Logistic Regression as a baseline model.

- Other possible models that can be used: Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

## 5. Model Evaluation

- The performance of the model is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  

## 6. Results

- The model works perfectly as the training dataset accuracy score is not significantly larger or miniscule than the testing data set.
  
- The model does not have issue with underfitting or overfitting.


## 7. How to run the Project

1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook step by step.

3. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and make necessary modifications.

## 8. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in detecting fraudulent transactions.
